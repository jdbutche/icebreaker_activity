I ate Brot in the Ratskeller. Then, I took a trip by train to Berlin, where I was born! I wish they had more klimaanlage over here! When I was driving down the Hauptstrasse, it came out of nowhere. An apfelkuchen flew straight at my windshield! After the initial panic, I noticed the lights turning off in the Baeckerei. I visited Eltz while wearing Lederhose. My best friend came wearing a dirndel and she nearly tripped while being chased by a hund. While visiting, I was able to enjoy some Gebaeck! I would like to participate in the wettbewerbsfaehig gebaeck eating competition some day. I hope that professor Mehlhase will be competing as well. Don't forget your lederhose! Because the prize is a BMW! (I hope the color matches my Schloss.)
